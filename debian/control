Description: Common support for todo.txt packages
 The Todo.txt project defines a format for supporting context-rich tasking in a
 plain text file. It supports an ecosystem of tools which allow working with
 tasks across hosts and operating systems.
 .
 This package installs resources used by todo.txt packages. It should not be
